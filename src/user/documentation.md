Enhance the documentation for the following TypeScript function or method using the guidelines below:

- Before writing the documentation understand the function or method being documented:

  - Read the function or method to understand its purpose and what it does.
  - I may have provided additional context which can aid you in understanding.

- After understanding its purpose and what the method or function does:

  - Generate concise JSDoc-style documentation covering the prioritized areas.
  - Present the high-level breakdown as succinctly as possible in Jsdoc descriptions in a bulleted list.
  - Include descriptions, parameter types, return types, and examples as appropriate.
  - Remember that it's hard to be too concise as documentation is tech debt.
