Analyze the following errors, logs and/or code snippet context using the steps below:

1. Exploration:

   1. List 4–6 possible causes for the issue (e.g. type mismatches, async race conditions, logic errors, configuration problems).
   2. Present each possibility as a bullet point.

2. Prioritization:

   1. From the possibilities above, identify the 1–2 most likely causes.
   2. Briefly explain why these are the top candidates.

3. Validation & Next Steps:
   1. Propose specific logging statements or assertions (include code snippets if needed) to verify your assumptions.
   2. Conclude with a recommended next action (e.g., “Add these logs to confirm…” or “Implement the fix for the identified cause”).

Now, analyze the following input:
